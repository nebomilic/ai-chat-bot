With this app, you can create your chatbot by providing a set of texts that the chatbot will use to generate responses.

Will will illustrate this with an example.

ðŸ‘‰ We have added a couple of texts that contain car names, their value and rating:

## Setup

This project is loosely based on [ai-getting-started](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-getting-started/) repo. Therefore is a part of the setup similar to the original repo.

Used stack is:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) - text generation
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) - authentication

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Frontend & API

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```
